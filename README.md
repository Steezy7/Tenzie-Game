# Tenzie-Game
This is a Tenzies dice game built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS that recreates the classic game experience in a modern web interface. Players roll dice, hold selected values, and aim to match all dice in the fewest rolls and time possible. The project demonstrates state management, game logic, and responsive UI design.
